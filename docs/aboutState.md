# React Props and State

## State
State is nothing more than being able to persists the value of attributes.  State itself is a single object.  Whle my description here is simplistic, it's also a good way to look at it.

For example, let's say your app allows the user to type a customer number in order to query the details ofthis customer.  You need to refer to this customer number in order to use it in a query to tyour database.  When the query is done, you want to save the value of the custoer details inc ase the user needs to update this customer.  (For example, a change of address...).

You could therefore, do something like this...

```


```
